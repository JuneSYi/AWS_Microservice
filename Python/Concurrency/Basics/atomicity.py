----------------------------
When the dis.dis(increment) function is called, it is disassembling the bytecode 
for the increment function and displaying it in a human-readable format. 
The numbers on the left represent the line numbers of the bytecode, and the 
instructions on the right are the corresponding bytecode instructions.

This code imports the dis module which allows for the disassembly of Python bytecode. 
The code then defines a global variable count and a function increment which increments 
the value of count by 1. When dis.dis(increment) is called, it disassembles the bytecode 
of the increment function.

The bytecode shows that the function first loads the global variable count onto the top
of the stack, then loads the value 1 onto the stack, performs an in-place 
add operation on the top two values on the stack, stores the result back into 
the global variable count, loads the value 'None' on the stack, and 
then returns the value on the top of the stack.

This code also illustrates a race condition that can occur when multiple threads execute 
the same function in parallel. It is possible for two threads to execute the function 
at the same time and one thread may be switched out by the Python interpreter just before 
the third instruction is executed. Now the second thread comes along and execute all the 
six bytecode instructions in one go, when the first thread is rescheduled by the interpreter, 
it execute the third instruction but the value the thread holds is stale, causing it to 
incorrectly update the count variable, which may result in an incorrect or unexpected value 
for the count variable.
