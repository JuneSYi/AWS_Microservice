'''
There are two basic formats for JSON data. Either in a string or the object datastructure. 
The object datastructure, in Python, consists of lists and dictionaries nested inside each other. 
The object datastructure allows one to use python methods (for lists and dictionaries) to add, list, 
search and remove elements from the datastructure. 
The String format is mainly used to pass the data into another program or load into a datastructure.

import json 

json_string = json.dumps([1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c"])
# json.dumps() function will convert a subset of Python objects into a json string

print(json.loads(json_string))
# To load JSON back to a data structure, use the "loads" method. This method takes a string and turns it back into the json object datastructure

# adds the given name and salary pair to salaries_json, and returns it
def add_employee(salaries_json, name, salary):
    salaries = json.loads(salaries_json)
    salaries[name] = salary

    return json.dumps(salaries)

# test code
salaries = '{"Alfred" : 300, "Jane" : 400 }'
new_salaries = add_employee(salaries, "Me", 800)
decoded_salaries = json.loads(new_salaries)
print(decoded_salaries["Alfred"])
# 300
print(decoded_salaries["Jane"])
# 400
print(decoded_salaries["Me"])
# 800
